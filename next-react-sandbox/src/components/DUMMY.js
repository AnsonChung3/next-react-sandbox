    `A self-taught junior software developer trying to start a career in tech. Specialising in JavaScript, with good exposure to Python. Most of my past projects were built with Vue.js, and I've dipped into React and React Native to broaden my front-end toolkit. Comfortable using Git via the command line, and Docker to keep environments consistent.`,
    `I moved to the UK just before Covid and used that time to reflect on what I wanted to do long term. Before relocating, I worked in a shipping liner company that owned container vessels, which gave me exposure to large-scale operations and problem solving. Since moving here, I worked in a care home for a while and have now moved on to volunteering at the World Heritage Centre and Victoria Art Gallery in Bath, where I connect with visitors and share my knowledge of the city.`,
    `Other than code, I enjoy knitting and sewing. They both allow creative engineering. There are patterns to follow and foundamental techniques to learn, but also plenty of room to experiment and design something unique. I find the process of working step by step towards a finished piece both practical and rewarding.`,
